# Ya gotta start somewhere

So ... HOS is off to a good start, I think.

I've hit a bit of a wall, though: the version of [HOS](https://github.com/bsgbryan/hos) I've built to this point is based on the excellent [tutorial servies](https://os.phil-opp.com) by Philipp Oppermann. The thing is, that series is based on the x86_64 architecture; I want HOS to work on the Aarch64 architecture - specifically, Raspberry Pis. Of course, there's a great [tutorial series](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials/blob/master/20_timer_callbacks/kernel_symbols/src/main.rs) for that as well - mapping that work to what I've already got, however, is no simple task ...

Designing/building an OS is complicated - who'da thunk?!

# So, what now?

Well, I've got a lot of learning to do.

Specifically, I'm going to finish reading [Operating Systems: Three Easy Steps](https://ostep.org) and familarize myself with C to the point that I can make heads or tails of [the work](https://github.com/bztsrc/raspi3-tutorial) the Raspberry Pi OS tutorials is built on - by, at a minimum, reading through [Effective C](https://nostarch.com/Effective_C).

This means it'll likely be some time before I make anymore commits to the HOS repo, which makes me sad üòû

I'd like to take the time to properly develop the skills/knownledge before pushing too deep into development; I'd rather not code myself into a corner too quikly üòú

# Back to it, then!

Alrighty ... I think I'll clean this site's content up a bit, get it published, and get back to reading!

Se y'all soon! ü§òüèª
